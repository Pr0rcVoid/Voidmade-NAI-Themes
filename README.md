# Voidmade-NAI-Themes
Just a repository to share the core themes I made for NovelAI

# Why custom themes?
Because it's possible to make them and I need to use my meager understanding of webdev for *something*.

# Available themes

Currently there's only 3-ish themes I made.
## Violet Void
My own main-stay I initially shared for reasons of plausible deniability. It uses a lot of transparency that usually breaks when the UI gets updated. Use at your own risk!

## Lascivious Lamia
Made for anon, who wanted something plain and simple for his precious mobile eyes. No transparency here, just brown, gold and some green.

## Novel Dungeon
Nostalgic, sort of.

# How do I Theme?

Luckily it's a lot easier nowadays. Just import it and the menu for themes will pop up.

# Fin
That's it for now.
